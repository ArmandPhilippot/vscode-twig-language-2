## Installation

Install through Visual Studio Code extensions. Search for `Twig Language 2`

[Visual Studio Code Market Place: Twig Language 2](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mblode.twig-language-2)

## What has changed since version 1?

I have created a new extension to fix the issues that I (and all of you) were having with file associations, issues with commenting and also the most important issue with the icon in the sidebar.

Simply add these lines to your VSCode settings to get emmet and HTML Intellisense working and also to associate HTML files as twig syntax.

```
"files.associations": {
    "*.html": "twig"
},
"emmet.includeLanguages": {
    "twig": "html"
},
```
